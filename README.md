Movie Recommendation System


A sophisticated content-based movie recommendation system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and movie attributes.

Overview:-
This project implements a content-based filtering approach using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and cosine similarity to generate movie recommendations. The system analyzes various movie attributes including titles, cast, crew, genres, and plot descriptions to suggest similar movies that align with user preferences.

Features:-
Content-based movie recommendation using TF-IDF vectorization
Cosine similarity calculation for movie matching
Comprehensive movie attribute analysis
User-friendly interface for movie searches
Top-N movie recommendations
Visualization of movie statistics and trends

Dataset:-
The project uses two primary datasets:

credits.csv: Contains movie credits information (movie ID, title, cast, crew)
movies.csv: Contains movie metadata (budget, genres, release dates, overview, etc.)

Key Attributes:-

Movie ID
Title
Cast & Crew
Budget
Genres
Release Date
Overview
Popularity Metrics
Vote Count & Average
